This was a project to design a (fictional) company website using HTML and CSS, primarily to teach myself Flexbox and Responsive Design.

The website has an inline flex nav menu that switches to a burger menu below a certain screen width, based on rem. 

It also flips from a horizonal flex layout to a vertical one for content, again based on screen size.
